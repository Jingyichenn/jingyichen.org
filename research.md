*Anankastic Conditionals are Conditionals with Harmonizing Modals* (co-authored with Valentine Hacquard) To appear in the proceedings of *Sinn und Bedeutung 29*. 

Standard accounts of modals and conditionals fail to derive the correct meaning of anankastic conditionals. This has led to proposals for an idiosyncratic semantics of *want* or a hidden purpose clause construction for anankastic conditionals. We argue that the problem is more general, and so is its solution. We offer a pragmatic account of anankastic conditionals that generalizes across modal flavors and attitudes. This general solution to anankastic conditionals and its kin can predict when ananakastic readings are possible, when they are not, and how they can be derived without relying on any flavor-specific idiosyncrasies.
