*Anankastic Conditionals are Modal Subordination* [[poster]](static/poster_macsim.pdf) 

Standard accounts of modals and conditionals fail to derive the correct meaning of anankastic conditionals. This has led to proposals for an idiosyncratic semantics of *want* or a hidden purpose clause construction for anankastic conditionals. I argue that the problem is more general, and so is its solution: anankastic conditionals are modal subordination.
