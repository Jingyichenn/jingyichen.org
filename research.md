*Anankastic Conditionals are Modal Subordination* [[poster]](static/Poster.pdf) 

Standard accounts of modals and conditionals fail to derive the correct meaning of anankastic conditionals. This has led to proposals for an idiosyncratic semantics of *want* or a hidden purpose clause construction for anankastic conditionals. I argue that the problem is more general, and so is its solution: anankastic conditionals are modal subordination. Hence, there is nothing special about *want*, nor anankastic conditionals.

*Imperatives as Fragment Answers* [MA Thesis]

Imperatives can be answers to questions. That creates a dilemma. It seems to force us to choose between the predominant semantics of imperatives on which imperatives are non-propositional, and the standard semantics of questions on which answers are propositions and questions are sets of them. This paper presents the dilemma and offers a solution. To preserve the non-propositional semantics of imperatives, I argue that imperatival answers are fragment answers. To retain the propositional nature of answers, I proffer a discourse function-oriented mechanism for constructing propositions from imperatives pragmatically. Specifically, I show that the pragmatically constructed contents of imperatival answers are similar to the propositional contents expressed in anankastic conditionals.
