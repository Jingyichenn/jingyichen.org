I am a PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Maryland, advised by [Valentine Hacquard](https://valentinehacquard.org) and [Aron Hirsch](https://sites.google.com/view/aronhirsch/home). I work on semantics. Specifically, I am interested in modality, conditionals, and their interactions with attitude verbs. 

Before coming to UMD, I earned a bachelor's in philosophy from Rutgers University and a master's in philosophy from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, advised by [Peter van Elswyk](https://sites.northwestern.edu/vanelswyk/) and [Nick Fleisher](https://sites.uwm.edu/fleishen/).
