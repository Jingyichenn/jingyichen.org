I'm a PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Maryland, advised by [Valentine Hacquard](https://valentinehacquard.org) and Alexander Williams. I work on semantics.

Before coming to UMD, I earned a bachelor's in philosophy from Rutgers University and a master's in philosophy from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, advised by Peter van Elswyk and Nick Fleisher, who helped me find my way into linguistics.

When not thinking about words, I like to run and be upside down.

You can contact me at jchen7 [at] umd [dot] edu.
